# Node Chat Application

This repository will/contains the code from following [tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/).

These are the changes that I have made in following the tutorial to make development a bit easier:

1. Started the project using the following [Yeoman Node Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-node).
2. Incorporated [gulp-live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-live-server) for starting/serving the node app.
3. I am using [the live-reload Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) for reloading the page on server/static file changes.
